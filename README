NAME
    Text::Context - Handle highlighting search result context snippets

SYNOPSIS
      use Text::Context;

      my $snippet = Text::Context->new($text, @keywords);

      $snippet->keywords("foo", "bar"); # In case you change your mind

      print $snippet->as_html;
      print $snippet->as_text;

DESCRIPTION
    Given a piece of text and some search terms, produces an object which
    locates the search terms in the message, extracts a reasonable-length
    string containing all the search terms, and optionally dumps the string
    out as HTML text with the search terms highlighted in bold.

  new
    Creates a new snippet object for holding and formatting context for
    search terms.

  keywords
    Accessor method to get/set keywords. As the context search is done
    case-insensitively, the keywords will be lower-cased.

  paras
        @paras = $self->paras($maxlen)

    Return shortened paragraphs to fit together into a snippet of at most
    $maxlen characters.

  as_text
    Calculates a "representative" string which contains the given search
    terms. If there's lots and lots of context between the terms, it's
    replaced with an ellipsis.

  as_html([ start => "<some tag>", end => "<some end tag>" ])
    Markup the snippet as a HTML string using the specified delimiters or
    with a default set of delimiters ("<span class="quoted">").
